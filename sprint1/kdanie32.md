### What you planned to do
- Learn Sha256
- Write a basic blockchain code


### What you did not do
- I have not uploaded the blockchain code, but it will be done latest by Wensday

### What problems you encountered
- Figuring out how the blockchain verification works

### Issues you worked on
(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/3) I worked on making the blockchain code
(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/6) I am working on adding info to blockchain and verifying it

### Files you worked on
https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/blob/main/blockchain_example.py

### What you accomplished
I have almost completed a implementation of a blockchain program to take in information and use sha256 to create hash values for added information on the chain.
I am also trying to verify if a chain has been tampered with
