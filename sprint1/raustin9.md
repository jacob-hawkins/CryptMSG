Reagan Austin (raustin9)
CryptMSG

### Plans
- Edit design document [link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/22)
- Style front end messaging [link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/23)


### Did not complete
- All issues I set are closed, but I passed off creating the messaging template to Jacob, so I did not complete that one.

### Problems encountered
- Trying to figure out how figma works in order to create a good design mock up

### Issues worked on
- Create front end React Site [link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/1)
- Start a design document on figma [link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/5)
- Edit css on main page [link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/21)

### Files worked on
- cryptmsg-site/src/APP.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/APP.css
- README.md
- Figma design doc

### Accomplishments
I was able to get a base react site up to work on.
I have created some trial figma documents to figure out how to start a maintainable one for the actual project.
