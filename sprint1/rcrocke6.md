# Sprint 1

Riley Crockett (rcrocke6)
CryptMSG

### Original Plans
- Add keypress functionality for sending messages (Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/14))
- Add formatting for received and sent messages (Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/13))
- Dynamically add messages to the frontend (Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/11))

### Partially finished
- Issue #13 made a basis for differentiating the messages but they need to be further formatted.

### Problems encountered
- I'm not that experienced with react, and it took some time to understand how to work with certian components.

### Files worked on
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/Chatbox.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/Chatbox.css

### Accomplishments
The dynamic message creation made the front-end actually feel like messaging system, and will make it 
easier to further format the messages. It should also scale well once we get the back-end connected, since
the messages are separated and makes it easier differentiate the sent/received messages.
