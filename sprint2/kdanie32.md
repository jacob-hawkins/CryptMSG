# Sprint 2

Kijan Daniel, KijanDaniel, CryptMSG (include your name, github id, and group name here)

### What you planned to do
- Connect the front and backend
- Explore Rust
- Explore rocket in rust
- Write a basic blockchain code


### What you did not do
- Fully connect the front and backend

### What problems you encountered
- Learning rust is has a bit of a learning curve

### Issues you worked on
(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/42) This is connecting front and backend
(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/37) This is a blockchain issue
(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/36) This is another blockchain issue

### Files you worked on

### What you accomplished
I got blockchain working but then we decided to switch over to a p2p service and we are using rust to program the backend now. I have begun to play with rocket in rust and learning rust to be able to connect the front and backend.
