# Sprint 2

Reagan Austin (raustin9)
CryptMSG

### Plans
- Add paging system (Issue 41) [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/41)
- Add tmp msg box for incoming messages to be display for testing (Issue 43) [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/43)
- Create Sidebar (Issue 38) [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/38)
- autoresize input text box (Issue 32) [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/32)


### Did not complete
- I moved the paging system forward a sprint because it might impact the direction the project goes, and we need to decide
- Adding temporary msg box is not necessary at the moment as we have other means of testing

### Problems encountered
- Figuring out how to resize a text box automatically with react was a little tricky but not too bad

### Issues worked on
- Issue 41 [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/41)
- Issue 43 [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/43)

- Issue 32 [Link](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/32)

### Files worked on
- cryptmsg-site/src/APP.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/APP.css
- cryptmsg-site/src/components/Navbar/index.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/components/Navbar/navbar.css

### Accomplishments
The UI is more complete with a sidebar and navbar, and it looks and feels like a proper messaging system
The textarea for input messages resizes up and down automatically
