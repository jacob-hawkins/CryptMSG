# Sprint 2

Riley Crockett (rcrocke6)
CryptMSG

### Original Plans
- Dynamically size the message board to grow with messages and position it correctly. (Issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/35)
- Add a contacts/conversations tab. (Issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/28)
- Add a chat settings tab for the current conversation. (Issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/29)
- Abstract some of the message functions in Chatbox.js. (Issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/CryptMSG/issues/39)

### Partially finished
The settings tabs are just frameworks at the moment, and might need some modifications when we link it with the backend. (Issues 28/29)

### Problems encountered
There were no major issues, only some hiccups when abstracting some of the JS functions and grouping elements with CSS.

### Files worked on
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/App.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/App.css
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/Chatbox.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/ChatSettings.js
- cryptmsg-site/src/Pages/ChatSettings.css


### Accomplishments
The settings tabs will make it easier for us to organize and add more information to the site when we connect the backend.
