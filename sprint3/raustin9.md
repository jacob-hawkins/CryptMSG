### Did not complete
None

### Problems encountered
- It was hard to figure out how to store the time messages were sent, and 
I went through seeing if making a component for the message would be right,
but I eventually just landed on adding a new element in the html when a msg
is created

### Accomplishments
Messages now feel more "real" because you can see when they were sent or received. I think this is because it feels similar to iMessage. I also 
created a page switching mechanism, so now we have capabilities to message between many different people.
