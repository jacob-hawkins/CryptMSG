# Product Requirements Document
Name: Kijan Daniel

Product Name: Cryptmsg App

## Background
With hackers becoming more and more predominant we want to make an app that is an encrypted messaging service. On top of that there will be a private login for each individual user. This will make for a safe messaging experience where someone else will not be able to listen in. 

## Project Overview
The product will be an encrypted messaging app. This app will have various features including chat rooms with no limit on the amount of users in a given chat room, and have individual login for each user with their own unique account name and password. In addition to this this product will be able to be run off of a local or public server.

## Features
Give at least 8 user stories to describe required features. These can come from the issues assigned to you during the 4 sprints, or you 
can create new items. Give a title or feature name for each story. Example: 
1. Creating a Localized server: As an operator I want to make sure that a user would be able to run their own localized server on their network for maximum security. This will let the user make their own servers with just a simple command.
bank.
2. Adjust user settings and dark mode: As an operator I want to make sure that my user has some customizability on what their own personal app looks like. This leads the developer to make custom settings for each time you load the app to be able to manipulate. This will let the users pick their own themes for the look of the app. 
3. Have an infinite number of members per chat room: As an operator I want to make sure that I can have an infinite number of people per chat room, so that I can have party chats. This will let my users be able to have large meetings and gaming session calls on my platform.
4. Have an unique website url: As an operator I want to make my messaging app have its own url under which they can visit my website, so that the messaging app will feel more sophisticated and unique.
5. Make sure the user is protected with https encryption: As an operator I want to make sure that the users messages are encrypted via https encryption, so that they will feel secure while using the messaging app.
6. Login service for users: As an operator of the messaging app I want to be able to have a login service that keeps track of the accounts that have been made by users. I want to have this feature so that I can see what users are using the app, and so the consumer has a unique account that they can log into. This will achieve a potential for databases that can store and sort users in the future.
7. Let users log in with external accounts: As an operator I want to make it so that my users are able to log in with accounts created with other large companies such as google for the ease of use.
8. Use the app on a phone: As an operator I want to make sure that I give my users maximum accessibility, so I will make sure my app has ios and android support. 

## Technologies to be used
The technologies that will be used in this encrypted messaging app will be rocket, react Js, and Rust. The rocket code will be used to launch a server on which the users will be able to communicate through. The react JS will be used to create the front end of the app. Finally, the programming language Rust will be able to incorporate rocket and that will create a solid back-end framework.  that will be used.
