# What you accomplished
I made it so that the user cannot message without first being in a chatroom
This is so that they cannot randomly start sending messages without
being connected. I also styled it and connected it to the parent component,
so now we have a solid parent-child hierarchy for some of our other components to now, so many components can share data across eachother.
